**Contribution Intent, Rules, and Operating Principles**

---

## Why this file exists

This repository may be read, extended, or modified by:

▪️ Human contributors
▪️ AI assistants or agents
▪️ Hybrid human–AI workflows

This file defines **non-negotiable intent and constraints** so that all contributions remain consistent, useful, and aligned with real DevOps needs.

If you contribute to this repository, you are expected to follow these rules.

---

## Core intent (do not drift)

This repository exists to:

> **Help teams using Harness understand pipeline failures, observability signals,
> and AI-assisted insights well enough to make better decisions under pressure.**

This is **enablement documentation**, not marketing, not a tutorial catalog, and not a feature index.

If a contribution does not improve **decision clarity during failures**, it does not belong here.

---

## Primary audience (anchor)

All content must be written primarily for:

**Platform, DevOps, and Enablement teams operating Harness in production.**

Secondary audiences:
▪️ Engineers interacting with pipelines
▪️ Technical leadership reviewing reliability, risk, and MTTR

Do **not** write for:
⚠️ Beginners learning CI/CD fundamentals
⚠️ Sales or marketing audiences
⚠️ Academic or research contexts

---

## What this repository is NOT

To prevent scope creep, contributors must avoid:

⚠️ Feature-by-feature explanations
⚠️ Vendor marketing language
⚠️ Step-by-step UI click guides without context
⚠️ Organization-specific workflows
⚠️ Internal or confidential examples

This repository documents **how to think and respond**, not how to click.

---

## Tone and writing style

All content must be:

▪️ Calm and neutral
▪️ Clear and direct
▪️ Free of hype
▪️ Free of absolutes
▪️ Respectful of human judgment

Avoid:
⚠️ “Best / worst” claims
⚠️ Over-promising AI capabilities
⚠️ Fear-based or alarmist language

AI is treated as an **assistant**, not an authority.

---

## Decision-first documentation rule

Every document should answer at least one of these questions:

▪️ What decision does a team need to make here?
▪️ What signal should they trust first?
▪️ What should they ignore?
▪️ When should a human override automation?
▪️ What failure mode does this prevent?

If none apply, rethink the contribution.

---

## AI usage guidelines

AI-generated content is allowed **only if**:

▪️ It is reviewed by a human
▪️ It aligns with the intent of this repository
▪️ It does not invent features or behaviors
▪️ It avoids hallucinated product capabilities

AI should assist clarity, not replace judgment.

---

## Screenshots and examples

All screenshots must:

▪️ Come from demo or sandbox environments
▪️ Be sanitized and redacted
▪️ Avoid organization names, emails, IDs, and URLs
▪️ Be clearly labeled as illustrative

Refer to:
`assets/screenshots/redaction-guide.md`

---

## Structure and formatting rules

▪️ Use Markdown (`.md`) only
▪️ One concept per file
▪️ Clear headings and short sections
▪️ Bullet points over long prose
▪️ Avoid excessive nesting
▪️ Use consistent formatting across documents (headings, lists, section order)

File names should be descriptive and stable.

---

## Validation before contributing

Before opening a pull request, confirm:

▪️ This content improves real-world failure handling
▪️ This content reduces confusion during incidents
▪️ This content would help a DevOps team under pressure

If not, do not submit it.

---

## Final principle

> **If this documentation does not help someone
> debug, decide, or recover faster,
> it does not belong in this repository.**

This principle overrides all others.
